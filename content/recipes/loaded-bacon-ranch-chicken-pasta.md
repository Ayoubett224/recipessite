## Ingredients

- 1 pound pasta (penne, rotini, or farfalle work well)
- 1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup ranch dressing (store-bought or homemade)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
2.  While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
3.  Add the chopped onion to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
4.  Stir in the condensed cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and ranch dressing. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly.
5.  Add the cooked pasta and chicken to the skillet. Toss to coat everything evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency.
6.  Stir in the crumbled bacon, Parmesan cheese, and shredded cheddar cheese. Toss until the cheese is melted and everything is well combined.
7.  Serve immediately and garnish with extra bacon and Parmesan cheese, if desired.

## Pro Tips

-   For extra crispy bacon, cook it in a dry skillet until it’s rendered its fat and then add it to the pasta.
-   If you don’t have cream of chicken soup, you can substitute with 1 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of milk.
-   Don’t overcook the pasta! Al dente is key for the best texture.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store leftover Loaded Bacon Ranch Chicken Pasta in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or on the stovetop.
