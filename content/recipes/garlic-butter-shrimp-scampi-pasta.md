## Ingredients

- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 8 ounces linguine or spaghetti
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. While the pasta cooks, pat the shrimp dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

3. Add the shrimp to the hot skillet in a single layer and cook for 1-2 minutes per side until pink and opaque. Remove shrimp and set aside on a plate.

4. Reduce heat to medium and add butter to the same skillet. Once melted, add minced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for about 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned.

5. Pour in the white wine and lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the sauce simmer for 2-3 minutes until slightly reduced.

6. Add the cooked pasta directly to the skillet with the sauce. Toss to coat, adding reserved pasta water a few tablespoons at a time if needed to loosen the sauce.

7. Return the shrimp to the skillet along with any accumulated juices. Add chopped parsley and toss everything together until well combined and heated through.

8. Remove from heat and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.

## Pro Tips

- Don't overcook the shrimp - they only need 2-3 minutes total cooking time. Overcooked shrimp become tough and rubbery.
- Use dry white wine that you'd actually drink - the flavor concentrates as it cooks down into the sauce.
- Reserve that pasta water! The starchy water helps create a silky sauce that clings perfectly to the pasta.
- For extra richness, add an additional tablespoon of butter at the very end when tossing everything together.
- If you don't have white wine, chicken broth works as a substitute, though you'll miss some of that authentic scampi flavor.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The pasta tends to absorb the sauce as it sits, so when reheating, add a splash of chicken broth or water to loosen the sauce. Reheat gently in a skillet over medium-low heat or in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each.
