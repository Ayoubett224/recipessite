Oh my goodness, you guys! Get ready to fall in love. These Creamy Strawberry Shortcake Cheesecake Bars are the ultimate springtime treat – a delightful blend of creamy cheesecake, sweet strawberries, and a hint of shortcake magic. I’ve always loved the combination of textures and flavors in a good dessert, and this recipe perfectly captures that. There’s something so comforting about a slice of homemade cheesecake, but these bars are so much easier to make and perfect for entertaining. Plus, the fresh strawberries elevate them to a whole new level of deliciousness!  These are ideal for brunch, afternoon tea, or any gathering where you want to impress your guests with a truly special dessert. Trust me, they'll disappear fast!




## Ingredients

* 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
* 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
* ¾ cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 1 ½ cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
* 1 cup whipped cream, for topping (optional)
* 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)



## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease and line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easy removal.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan to create a crust.
3. In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and granulated sugar together until smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes.
4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in the vanilla extract and sweetened condensed milk until fully incorporated.
5. Pour the cheesecake filling over the graham cracker crust and spread evenly.
6. Arrange the sliced strawberries evenly over the top of the cheesecake filling.
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center jiggles slightly.
8. Let the cheesecake bars cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.  This is important for the cheesecake to set properly!
9. Once cooled, dust with powdered sugar (optional) and top with whipped cream (optional) before serving.



## Pro Tips

- **Graham Cracker Crust:** For a crispier crust, bake the crust for 8-10 minutes before adding the cheesecake filling.
- **Strawberry Prep:** To prevent the strawberries from bleeding too much into the cheesecake, toss them with a tablespoon of lemon juice before arranging them on top.
- **Cooling is Key:** Don't skip the cooling time! This allows the cheesecake to firm up and develop its best texture.
