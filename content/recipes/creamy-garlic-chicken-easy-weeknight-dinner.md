**Why You'll Love This Recipe**  
- **5-Ingredient Simplicity**: Skip the fancy techniques—this dish relies on pantry staples like garlic, cream, and chicken thighs for maximum flavor.  
- **Creamy Without the Cream**: Achieve that luxurious texture using a mix of heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, no fancy equipment needed.  
- **Weeknight-Friendly**: Ready in under an hour, this recipe is ideal for hectic evenings when you still want something special.  
- **Customizable Twist**: Add red pepper flakes for heat or lemon zest for brightness—tailor it to your taste!  

## Ingredients  
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1 ½ lbs)  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 cup heavy cream  
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese  
- 1 cup chicken broth  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 tsp dried thyme  
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped  
- Salt and black pepper to taste  
- Optional: ¼ tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tbsp lemon zest  

## Instructions  
1. **Season the Chicken**: Pat chicken thighs dry and season both sides with salt, pepper, and thyme.  
2. **Sear the Chicken**: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken thighs 4–5 minutes per side until golden. Remove and set aside.  
3. **Make the Sauce**: In the same skillet, sauté minced garlic for 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a simmer.  
4. **Add Cream & Cheese**: Stir in heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, whisking until smooth. Simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened.  
5. **Combine & Simmer**: Return chicken to the skillet, coating in the sauce. Simmer 10–12 minutes until chicken is fully cooked and sauce clings to the meat.  
6. **Finish & Serve**: Garnish with fresh parsley and red pepper flakes (if using). Serve over rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes.  

## Pro Tips  
- **Thighs Over Breasts**: Chicken thighs stay juicier and add more flavor than breasts.  
- **Cream Substitute**: For a lighter version, swap heavy cream with coconut milk (adds a subtle sweetness).  
- **Batch Cooking**: Double the recipe and freeze half for quick meals later in the week.  

## Storage & Leftovers  
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of broth to maintain creaminess. Freeze for up to 2 months—thaw overnight and reheat.
