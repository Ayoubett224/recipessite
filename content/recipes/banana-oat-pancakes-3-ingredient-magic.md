It’s the solution to every busy morning, the answer to “what’s for breakfast?” that’s both incredibly simple and surprisingly delicious. By blending whole oats into a flour and using a ripe banana as the natural sweetener and binder, these pancakes are inherently gluten-free, packed with fiber, and come together faster than mixing a boxed mix.

Serve them with a drizzle of pure maple syrup, a handful of fresh berries, or a dollop of Greek yogurt for a truly satisfying meal.

## Why You'll Love This Recipe

*   **Naturally Healthy:** Packed with whole grains from oats, potassium from banana, and protein from eggs. It’s a balanced breakfast you can feel good about.
*   **Versatile & Customizable:** The base is a blank canvas. Easily add vanilla, cinnamon, or a scoop of protein powder to the batter.
*   **Pantry-Friendly:** Uses staple ingredients you likely already have on hand, making it perfect for last-minute breakfasts or clearing out a ripe banana.

## Ingredients

- 1 large **very ripe banana** (about 120g, mashed)
- 1 large **egg**
- 1/2 cup (40g) **rolled oats** (not instant)
- 1/4 teaspoon **baking powder** (optional, for fluffier pancakes)
- 1/4 teaspoon **ground cinnamon** (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon **pure vanilla extract** (optional)
- Cooking oil or butter, for the pan
- Toppings: pure maple syrup, fresh berries, sliced banana, nut butter, etc.

## Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Oat Flour:** Place the rolled oats in a blender or food processor. Blend on high speed for 30-45 seconds, or until the oats have turned into a fine, flour-like powder. Scrape down the sides if needed. This is your "flour" for the recipe.
2.  **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a medium mixing bowl, thoroughly mash the ripe banana with a fork until almost smooth with only a few small lumps remaining. Add the egg and optional vanilla extract, and whisk vigorously until well combined and slightly frothy.
3.  **Mix the Batter:** Add the blended oat flour, optional baking powder, and optional cinnamon to the banana-egg mixture. Stir with a spatula until just combined. The batter will be thick and slightly lumpy; do not overmix. Let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the oat flour to hydrate.
4.  **Heat the Pan:** Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Lightly brush the surface with a neutral oil (like avocado or canola) or a small pat of butter.
5.  **Cook the Pancakes:** Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot skillet for each pancake. Use the back of the spoon to gently spread it into a 4-inch circle. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the edges look set and the bottom is golden brown with a few bubbles forming on top.
6.  **Flip and Finish:** Carefully flip the pancake using a spatula. Cook for another 1-2 minutes on the second side until golden brown and cooked through. Adjust the heat to medium if the pancakes are browning too quickly before cooking through.
7.  **Repeat & Serve:** Repeat with the remaining batter, lightly oiling the pan between batches as needed. Serve immediately with your favorite toppings while hot.

## Pro Tips

- **Banana Ripeness is Key:** The spottier and softer the banana, the sweeter and easier it will mash. This is your primary sweetener.
- **Batter Consistency:** If your batter is too thick to pour (this can happen with different oat brands or banana size), add one teaspoon of milk (dairy or non-dairy) at a time until it reaches a thick but pourable consistency.
- **Flip Once:** Only flip the pancake once. The first flip is the most crucial—wait until the bottom is firmly golden and the top has bubbles before flipping for the best results.
- **Boost the Flavor:** Stir in 1-2 tablespoons of mini chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or a tablespoon of lemon zest into the batter after mixing.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store cooled pancakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a toaster, a skillet over medium heat, or in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. They also freeze well for up to 2 months; place parchment paper between them and reheat directly from frozen in a toaster.
