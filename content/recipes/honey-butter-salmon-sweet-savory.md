- **Versatile & Forgiving:** Works with oven-baking or stovetop searing; the glaze is flexible and hard to mess up.

## Ingredients

- 4 (6 oz) salmon fillets, skin-on or skinless
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for depth)
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for searing or coating)

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Salmon:** Pat the salmon fillets completely dry with paper towels. This ensures the skin gets crispy (if using skin-on) and helps the glaze adhere. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet or in a lightly oiled oven-safe skillet.
2. **Make the Glaze:** In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Whisk in the honey, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika (if using). Let it simmer gently for 1 minute, then remove from heat.
3. **Coat the Salmon:** Brush or spoon about half of the honey butter glaze generously over the top and sides of each salmon fillet. Reserve the remaining glaze for later.
4. **Cook the Salmon:** **Oven Method:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake salmon for 12-15 minutes, until just cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. **Stovetop Method:** Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high. Place salmon skin-side down (if applicable) and cook for 4-5 minutes until skin is crispy. Flip, reduce heat to medium, and cook for another 3-4 minutes.
5. **Glaze & Finish:** During the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, spoon the reserved glaze over the salmon. For oven cooking, you can switch to broil for 1-2 minutes to caramelize the glaze (watch closely!). For stovetop, simply spoon it over as it finishes.
6. **Rest & Serve:** Remove salmon from heat. Let it rest for 2-3 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh parsley before serving. The glaze will thicken slightly as it cools.

## Pro Tips

- **For Crispy Skin:** If using skin-on salmon, start it skin-side down in a hot pan and don’t move it for the first few minutes. Ensure the skin is completely dry before cooking.
- **Don’t Overcook:** Salmon cooks quickly! Check for doneness at the minimum time—it should be opaque and flake easily but still be moist in the center. The internal temperature should reach 125-130°F for medium-rare.
- **Glaze Variations:** Swap honey for maple syrup for a different flavor profile. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a sweet heat kick. A teaspoon of Dijon mustard adds a nice tang.
- **Best Pan:** A cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan provides even heat and excellent browning for stovetop preparation.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store leftover honey butter salmon in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a 300°F oven or a skillet over low heat to prevent the glaze from burning and the salmon from drying out. It’s also delicious served cold over a salad the next day.
