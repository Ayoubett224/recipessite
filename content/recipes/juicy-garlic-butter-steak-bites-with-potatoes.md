## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1.5 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup beef broth
- Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss the potato pieces with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper on a large baking sheet. Spread in a single layer.
2. Roast the potatoes for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and tender.
3. While potatoes are roasting, season the steak bites with smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
4. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the steak bites in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches to avoid overcrowding), and sear for 2-3 minutes per side, until browned but still pink inside. Don't cook them all the way through!
5. Remove the steak bites from the skillet and set aside.
6. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
7. Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Let the wine reduce for 2-3 minutes.
8. Stir in the butter, beef broth, parsley, and rosemary. Simmer for 1 minute, until the sauce slightly thickens.
9. Return the steak bites to the skillet and toss to coat with the garlic butter sauce.
10. Serve the steak bites immediately over the roasted potatoes. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges, if desired.

## Pro Tips

- **Don't Overcook the Steak:** The key to juicy steak bites is to avoid overcooking them. Aim for medium-rare (internal temperature of 130-135°F) for the best flavor and tenderness.
- **Potatoes' Crispiness:** For extra crispy potatoes, make sure they are not overcrowded on the baking sheet. A single layer is crucial!
- **Wine Substitute:** If you don’t have white wine, you can substitute with an equal amount of beef broth and a splash of lemon juice.
