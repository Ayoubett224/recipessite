## Ingredients
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 cups frozen corn kernels
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes (or to taste)
- 1/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 avocado, sliced
- 2 limes, cut into wedges

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, toss the chicken cubes with olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.
3. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes until cooked through and golden.
4. While the chicken cooks, prepare the street corn: In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and chili flakes until smooth.
5. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the frozen corn and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until charred in spots.
6. Remove corn from heat and stir in the mayonnaise mixture until well coated. Set aside.
7. Assemble bowls: Start with a base of cooked chicken, then top with street corn, crumbled cotija cheese, fresh cilantro, sliced avocado, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
8. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges on the side.

## Pro Tips
- For extra smoky flavor, grill the chicken and corn instead of baking/sautéing.
- Cotija cheese can be substituted with feta or Parmesan if unavailable.
- Add a scoop of black beans or quinoa for extra fiber and to make it vegetarian.

## Storage & Leftovers
Store components separately in airtight containers for up to 3 days. Reheat chicken and corn together before serving, and add fresh avocado and cilantro just before eating for the best texture and flavor.
