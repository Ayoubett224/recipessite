## Ingredients

- 1 large French bread loaf (about 16 inches)
- 1 lb thinly sliced ribeye steak or sirloin
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 1/2 cups shredded provolone cheese (or mozzarella)
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Slice the French bread loaf in half lengthwise. Hollow out some of the soft bread from the center of each half, leaving about a 1/2-inch border. Set aside.
3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced steak and cook for 2-3 minutes until browned. Remove steak from the skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the sliced onion and bell peppers. Sauté for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add garlic, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook for another 1-2 minutes.
5. Return the cooked steak to the skillet and stir to combine with the vegetables. Remove from heat.
6. Place the hollowed bread halves on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle half of the shredded cheese evenly inside each bread half.
7. Divide the steak and vegetable mixture evenly between the two bread halves, pressing it gently into the cheese.
8. Top each half with the remaining shredded cheese.
9. Brush the edges of the bread with melted butter.
10. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the bread is golden.
11. Remove from the oven, let cool for 5 minutes, then slice and serve. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.

## Pro Tips

- For extra flavor, add a splash of hot sauce or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to the steak mixture.
- Use a sharp knife to thinly slice the steak for the most tender texture.
- If you don't have provolone, mozzarella, cheddar, or even pepper jack work well.
- To make ahead, prepare the filling and store it in the fridge for up to 2 days before assembling and baking.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 350°F oven for 10-15 minutes or until warmed through.
