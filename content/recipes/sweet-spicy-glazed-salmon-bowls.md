## Ingredients  
- 4 salmon fillets (skin-on, 6 oz each)  
- 1/4 cup honey  
- 2 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp sriracha (adjust to taste)  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tbsp grated ginger  
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 cup cooked quinoa or brown rice  
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers, snap peas)  
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro or green onions  
- Salt and pepper to taste  
- Optional: lime wedges for serving  

## Instructions  
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pat salmon fillets dry and season both sides with salt and pepper.  
2. In a small bowl, mix honey, soy sauce, sriracha, garlic, ginger, and rice vinegar to create the glaze.  
3. Brush the glaze evenly over the salmon fillets. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the glaze is caramelized.  
4. While the salmon bakes, cook quinoa or rice according to package instructions.  
5. Steam or sauté your choice of vegetables until tender.  
6. Assemble the bowls by layering quinoa, vegetables, and salmon on a plate. Drizzle extra glaze on top if desired.  
7. Garnish with cilantro or green onions and serve with lime wedges.  

## Pro Tips  
- **Glaze Hack**: If you prefer a thicker glaze, simmer the mixture for 2-3 minutes before brushing it on.  
- **Spice Level**: Reduce sriracha to 1 tsp for a milder version or add chili flakes for extra heat.  
- **Meal Prep**: Make a large batch of glaze and store it in the fridge for up to 5 days to glaze future meals.  

## Storage & Leftovers  
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or oven to maintain texture.
