### Why You'll Love This Recipe  
- **Quick & Easy**: Ready in under 40 minutes, perfect for busy cooks.  
- **Flavor-Packed**: Sweet chili sauce, garlic, and ginger create an addictive umami-sweet-spicy balance.  
- **Versatile**: Use leftover chicken or make it ahead for meal prep.  
- **Pantry Staples**: Most ingredients are already in your fridge or pantry.  
- **Crowd-Pleasing**: A hit at potlucks, game days, or family dinners.  

## Ingredients  
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cubed  
- 2 tbsp honey  
- 1 tbsp chili garlic sauce (adjust for heat)  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar  
- 1 tsp sesame oil  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated  
- 1 tbsp cornstarch  
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds  
- 2 green onions, sliced  
- Optional: ½ tsp red chili flakes (for extra kick)  

## Instructions  
1. **Prep the Chicken**: In a bowl, toss chicken cubes with honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and chili flakes (if using). Let marinate for 10 minutes.  
2. **Coat for Crunch**: Dredge each chicken piece in cornstarch, shaking off excess for a light, crispy coating.  
3. **Cook the Bites**: Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken in batches, cooking 2-3 minutes per side until golden and cooked through. Alternatively, bake at 400°F (20 mins, flipping halfway).  
4. **Make the Sauce**: In a small pot, combine chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and 2 tbsp water. Simmer for 3-5 minutes until thickened.  
5. **Toss & Glaze**: Transfer cooked chicken to a bowl and pour sauce over it. Toss until evenly coated.  
6. **Garnish & Serve**: Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve warm with rice or veggies.  

## Pro Tips  
- **Oven-Fry Hack**: Skip frying by baking coated chicken on a parchment-lined tray for a healthier version.  
- **Spice It Up**: Add a dash of sriracha to the sauce for an extra kick.  
- **Meal Prep**: Store uncooked chicken bites in the freezer for up to 3 months—just fry or bake straight from frozen.  

## Storage & Leftovers  
Keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Reheat in the oven or skillet to maintain crispiness. Freeze unbaked bites for up to 2 months.
