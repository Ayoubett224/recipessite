## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 jalapenos, seeded and minced (adjust to your spice preference!)
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat!)
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 2 ripe avocados, diced
- 1 cup cooked quinoa
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- Salt and pepper to taste



## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, toss the cubed chicken with salt, pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper (if using). Ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the spices.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned chicken and cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through.
3. Add the sliced red onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the chicken. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until the onion is softened and translucent.
4. Stir in the minced jalapeno and cook for another minute, being careful not to burn the garlic.
5. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to slightly thicken and coat the chicken.
6. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the quinoa according to package directions.
7. To assemble the bowls, divide the cooked quinoa among four bowls.
8. Top each bowl with the spicy chicken mixture, diced avocado, halved cherry tomatoes, and chopped cilantro.
9. Drizzle each bowl with lime juice.
10. Serve immediately and enjoy!



## Pro Tips

- **Spice Level:**  Jalapenos can vary greatly in heat! Start with one and taste as you go, adding more if you desire a spicier bowl. You can also substitute with a pinch of red pepper flakes.
- **Avocado Ripeness:** Make sure your avocados are ripe but not overly soft. A slightly firm avocado will hold its shape better in the bowl.
- **Make Ahead:** The quinoa and chicken can be cooked ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  Assemble the bowls just before serving.
