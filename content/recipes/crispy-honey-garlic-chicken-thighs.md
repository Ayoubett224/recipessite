There’s something magical about a chicken thigh that’s both tender and crispy—like the perfect balance of comfort and indulgence. This honey‑garlic version brings that harmony to the table with a glossy, caramelized glaze that clings to each bite, while the garlic and ginger infuse a fragrant warmth that makes the whole house smell like a bustling Asian street market. I love making it for Sunday brunches, game‑day gatherings, or a cozy weeknight dinner when I want something fast but unforgettable. The secret? A quick sear in a hot skillet, a simple sauce that thickens beautifully, and a final broil that locks in the crisp. Serve it over steamed jasmine rice, alongside a crisp salad, or even on its own with a side of naan for a truly satisfying spread.

The recipe is a breeze: you only need a handful of pantry staples and a few fresh herbs, and the whole process fits into a single pan. The honey adds a subtle sweetness that balances the salty soy sauce, while the garlic and ginger give a bright, aromatic punch. Because the thighs are skin‑on, they develop a golden, crackling crust that stays juicy inside—no dry, overcooked chicken here. Whether you’re feeding a family of four or entertaining friends, this dish feels restaurant‑quality without the fuss.

## Ingredients
- 4 (about 600 g) skin‑on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- ½ tsp black pepper, freshly ground
- ¼ tsp red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tbsp sliced green onions, for garnish
- 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds, for garnish

## Instructions
1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels; season both sides with a generous pinch of salt and the black pepper.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Set aside as the sauce base.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or non‑stick pan over medium‑high heat. Add the chicken thighs skin‑side down and sear for 5–6 minutes until the skin is golden and crisp.
4. Flip the thighs and cook for another 2–3 minutes on the opposite side to brown evenly.
5. Pour the prepared sauce over the chicken, stirring to coat. Add the water to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.
6. Reduce the heat to medium and let the sauce simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and the chicken is fully cooked (internal temperature reaches 165 °F/74 °C), about 10–12 minutes.
7. If you prefer extra crisp, place the skillet under a broiler for 2–3 minutes, watching closely so the glaze doesn’t burn.
8. Transfer the thighs to a serving plate, drizzle any remaining sauce over the top, and garnish with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds.
9. Serve hot alongside steamed jasmine rice, a quick stir‑fry of snap peas, or a fresh cucumber salad for a balanced, vibrant meal.

## Pro Tips
- **Keep the skin on:** The skin is the secret to that satisfying crunch; if you prefer boneless thighs, ensure the skin is still attached before cooking.
- **Cornstarch trick:** Whisk the sauce with a tiny splash of cold water (1 tsp cornstarch + 1 tsp water) before adding it to the pan; this creates a glossy, thick glaze without the sauce breaking.
- **Spice level control:** Start with ¼ tsp red pepper flakes; add more if you love heat, or swap for a dash of chili oil for a deeper, smoky kick.
