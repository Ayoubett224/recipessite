- **Nutrient-Dense**: Packed with protein, fiber, and healthy fats from peanut butter and flaxseed  
- **Versatile**: Easily customizable with mix-ins like dried fruit, nuts, or seeds  

## Ingredients

- 1 cup natural peanut butter (unsweetened)  
- 1 cup pitted Medjool dates (about 10-12 dates)  
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder  
- ¼ cup ground flaxseed  
- ⅓ cup rolled oats (use certified gluten-free if needed)  
- ⅓ cup mini dark chocolate chips (sugar-free or 90% cocoa)  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- ¼ tsp sea salt  

## Instructions

1. Pit the dates and place them in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped and sticky.  
2. Add peanut butter, cocoa powder, flaxseed, oats, vanilla extract, and salt to the food processor.  
3. Pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand and starts clumping together.  
4. Transfer to a bowl and fold in chocolate chips until evenly distributed.  
5. Scoop tablespoon-sized portions and roll between your palms to form 1-inch balls.  
6. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  
7. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up.  
8. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  

## Pro Tips

- For a smoother texture, soak dates in warm water for 10 minutes before processing.  
- If the mixture feels too sticky, add 1-2 tbsp of oats or a splash of water to adjust.  
- Freeze for 30 minutes before storing for extra firmness in warmer climates.  

## Storage & Leftovers

Store energy bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months for longer storage. The flavors actually deepen after a day of chilling!
