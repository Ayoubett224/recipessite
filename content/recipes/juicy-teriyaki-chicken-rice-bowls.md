## Ingredients

-   1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
-   1 cup uncooked long-grain rice
-   2 cups water
-   1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium preferred)
-   1/4 cup honey
-   2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
-   1 tablespoon rice vinegar
-   1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 teaspoon sesame oil
-   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
-   1 tablespoon cornstarch
-   2 tablespoons cold water
-   1 cup broccoli florets
-   1 cup sliced carrots
-   1/2 cup sliced bell peppers (any color)
-   2 green onions, thinly sliced, for garnish
-   1 tablespoon sesame seeds, for garnish



## Instructions

1.  **Cook the Rice:** Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Combine the rice and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked through. Fluff with a fork and set aside.
2.  **Prepare the Teriyaki Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, mirin, rice vinegar, grated ginger, minced garlic, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes (if using).
3.  **Marinate the Chicken:** In a medium bowl, toss the chicken pieces with 1/4 cup of the teriyaki sauce. Let marinate for at least 10 minutes (or longer, if time allows).
4.  **Cook the Chicken:** Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and slightly caramelized, about 6-8 minutes.
5.  **Thicken the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and cold water to create a slurry. Add the slurry to the skillet with the chicken and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 1-2 minutes.
6.  **Steam the Vegetables:** While the chicken is cooking, steam the broccoli florets, sliced carrots, and bell peppers until tender-crisp, about 5-7 minutes. You can use a steamer basket or microwave them with a little water.
7.  **Assemble the Bowls:** Divide the cooked rice evenly among four bowls. Top with the teriyaki chicken and steamed vegetables.
8.  **Garnish and Serve:** Drizzle with the remaining teriyaki sauce, garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds, and serve immediately.



## Pro Tips

-   **For extra crispy chicken:** Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels before marinating. This helps them brown better in the skillet.
-   **Spice it up:** Add more red pepper flakes or a dash of sriracha to the teriyaki sauce for a spicier kick.
-   **Vegetable Variations:** Feel free to use any vegetables you like! Snow peas, edamame, or mushrooms would all be delicious additions.



## Storage & Leftovers

Store any leftover Juicy Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or oven.
