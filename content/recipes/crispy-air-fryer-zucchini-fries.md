Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or craving a quick bite, these fries are perfect for any occasion. The air fryer’s magic ensures they’re crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, all while using minimal oil. Plus, they’re packed with vitamins and fiber, making them a healthy alternative to traditional fries. This recipe is ideal for busy weeknights or when you want to impress guests with something fresh and easy.  

## Why You'll Love This Recipe  
- **Crispy without the oil**: Achieve that perfect crunch using just a little olive oil and air frying.  
- **Healthy and nutritious**: Loaded with vitamins and low in calories, these fries are a guilt-free indulgence.  
- **Easy as 1-2-3**: No complicated steps or special equipment needed—just your air fryer.  
- **Versatile serving**: Enjoy them as a snack, side dish, or even a main course with dips or sauces.  

## Ingredients  
- 2 medium zucchinis, sliced into 1/4-inch thick fries  
- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder  
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika  
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano  
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional for a spicy kick)  
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (optional for extra crunch)  

## Instructions  
1. **Preheat your air fryer** to 375°F (190°C). This ensures even cooking from the start.  
2. **Wash and dry the zucchinis** thoroughly. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin for a more uniform texture.  
3. **Slice the zucchini** into 1/4-inch thick fries. Place them in a large bowl.  
4. **Toss the zucchini fries** with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using). Mix well to coat evenly.  
5. **Add breadcrumbs** (if using) and toss again to coat the fries. This step is optional but adds a delightful crunch.  
6. **Arrange the fries** in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding for the best crispiness.  
7. **Air fry for 10 minutes**, then flip the fries and cook for another 8-10 minutes until golden and crispy.  
8. **Check for doneness** by biting into a fry. They should be tender inside with a crispy exterior. If needed, cook in batches.  
9. **Serve immediately** with your favorite dip, such as garlic aioli, tzatziki, or lemon wedges.  

## Pro Tips  
- **Use a wire rack**: Place the fries on a wire rack inside the air fryer basket to prevent sogginess and ensure even cooking.  
- **Double the batch**: These fries freeze well! Store them in an airtight container and reheat in the air fryer for a quick snack.  
- **Experiment with seasonings**: Try adding Parmesan cheese, nutritional yeast, or smoked paprika for unique flavor twists.  

## Storage & Leftovers  
Store leftover fries in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 350°F (175°C) for 5-7 minutes to restore crispiness.
