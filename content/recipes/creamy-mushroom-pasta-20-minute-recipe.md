## Why You'll Love This Recipe

- Uses simple pantry ingredients you likely already have
- Creamy, luxurious sauce that tastes like it simmered for hours
- Perfect vegetarian main dish or elegant side
- Easily customizable with your favorite mushrooms or add-ins

## Ingredients

- 12 oz fettuccine or spaghetti pasta
- 1 lb cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- ½ cup reserved pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.

2. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced mushrooms and cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes until they begin to brown.

3. Stir the mushrooms and continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes until they release their moisture and become golden brown.

4. Add minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using.

5. Reduce heat to medium and pour in heavy cream. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes until slightly thickened.

6. Add grated Parmesan cheese and stir until melted and incorporated into the sauce.

7. Add the drained pasta directly to the skillet with the mushroom cream sauce. Toss to coat, adding reserved pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency.

8. Remove from heat and stir in fresh parsley. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

9. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese on top.

## Pro Tips

- Don't overcrowd the pan when cooking mushrooms - work in batches if needed to ensure proper browning
- Use a mix of mushroom varieties like shiitake or portobello for deeper flavor complexity
- For a lighter version, substitute half-and-half for heavy cream
- Add a splash of white wine after cooking the garlic for extra depth
- The pasta water is crucial - its starch helps bind the sauce to the pasta

## Storage & Leftovers

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The sauce may thicken when chilled, so add a splash of milk or cream when reheating gently on the stovetop. This dish is best enjoyed fresh, as the pasta continues to absorb the sauce over time.
