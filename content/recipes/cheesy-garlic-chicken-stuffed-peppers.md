## Ingredients  

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs (about 1 lb)  
- 4 large bell peppers (any color, preferably red or yellow for sweetness)  
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or mozzarella for a milder flavor)  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 1 tablespoon olive oil  
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (or parsley)  
- 1 teaspoon paprika  
- 1/2 teaspoon salt  
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  
- 1/4 cup chicken broth (or water)  
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (optional, for texture)  

## Instructions  

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).  
2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then cook in a skillet with olive oil over medium heat until browned and cooked through. Set aside to cool.  
3. Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them in a baking dish.  
4. In a bowl, mix the cooked chicken, shredded cheese, minced garlic, chopped onion, herbs, paprika, salt, and pepper. Add chicken broth to create a moist filling.  
5. Stuff each pepper with the chicken mixture, pressing it in gently. If using breadcrumbs, sprinkle them on top for a crunchy texture.  
6. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is bubbly.  
7. Let the stuffed peppers cool for 5 minutes before serving.  

## Pro Tips  

- **Cheese choice matters**: Use a sharp cheddar for a bold flavor or blend cheeses for complexity.  
- **Avoid soggy peppers**: Don’t overfill the peppers; leave a little space for expansion during baking.  
- **Make ahead**: Prepare the filling in advance and stuff the peppers just before baking to save time.  

## Storage & Leftovers  

These Cheesy Garlic Chicken Stuffed Peppers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 15–20 minutes to restore their texture.
