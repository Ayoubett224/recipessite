## Ingredients

*   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6-8 oz each)
*   1 (10 oz) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed VERY dry
*   1 (14 oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
*   1 (8 oz) package cream cheese, softened
*   1 cup sour cream
*   1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
*   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 teaspoon dried oregano
*   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
*   1/2 teaspoon salt
*   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a kick)
*   1/4 cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio) - optional but recommended
*   2 tablespoons olive oil
*   2 tablespoons butter
*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
*   1/2 cup chicken broth
*   1/2 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1.  **Prep & Preheat:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt, pepper, and a pinch of oregano.
2.  **Sauté Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken to a plate and let rest.
3.  **Make the Sauce:** In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Sprinkle in the flour and stir constantly for 1 minute to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the chicken broth and white wine (if using). Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly (about 2-3 minutes). Reduce heat to low.
4.  **Combine Cheeses & Greens:** Reduce the heat to low. Add the softened cream cheese, sour cream, 1 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and the thawed spinach to the skillet. Stir constantly until the cream cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. Stir in the quartered artichoke hearts, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and the red pepper flakes (if using). Taste and adjust salt and pepper.
5.  **Assemble:** Spread about 1/2 cup of the creamy sauce mixture evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place the cooked chicken breasts on top. Spoon the remaining sauce generously over the chicken, ensuring it's well-coated.
6.  **Bake:** Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese evenly over the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches 165°F / 74°C) and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
7.  **Rest & Serve:** Let the bake rest for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the sauce to set slightly. Serve hot, garnished with extra fresh parsley if desired.

## Pro Tips

*   **Use Rotisserie Chicken:** For maximum convenience, substitute 2 cups of shredded rotisserie chicken for the baked chicken breasts. Just skip step 2.
*   **Spinach is Key:** Squeezing the spinach *very* dry is crucial to prevent a watery sauce. Use a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth.
*   **Fresh Spinach Option:** If using fresh spinach, sauté it in the skillet with the garlic for 2-3 minutes until wilted and drained before adding it to the sauce.
*   **Adjust Spiciness:** Omit the red pepper flakes or increase to taste for more heat.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave until warmed through.
