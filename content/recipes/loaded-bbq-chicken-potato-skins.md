## Ingredients

- 4 large russet potatoes (about 2 lbs)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon black pepper, divided
- 2 cups cooked chicken, shredded or diced (rotisserie chicken works perfectly)
- ½ cup your favorite BBQ sauce (plus extra for drizzling)
- 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- 4 green onions, thinly sliced
- ½ cup sour cream, for serving
- ¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Bake the Potatoes:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Scrub the potatoes clean, prick them all over with a fork, and rub with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and ½ teaspoon of salt. Place directly on the oven rack and bake for 45-60 minutes, until fork-tender. Let them cool until you can handle them.
2. **Prep the Shells:** Slice each potato in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out most of the potato flesh, leaving about a ¼-inch thick shell. Reserve the scooped potato for another use (like mashed potatoes!) or discard. Place the shells on a baking sheet.
3. **Crisp the Shells:** Brush the inside and outside of each potato shell with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with the remaining ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Bake for 10 minutes to crisp them up.
4. **Make the Filling:** While the shells crisp, combine the shredded chicken and BBQ sauce in a medium bowl, stirring until well coated.
5. **Assemble:** Divide the BBQ chicken mixture evenly among the crispy potato shells. Top each generously with shredded cheddar cheese.
6. **Final Bake:** Return the loaded skins to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and bubbly.
7. **Garnish & Serve:** Remove from the oven and immediately top with sliced green onions. Serve hot with sour cream on the side and an extra drizzle of BBQ sauce if desired. Garnish with fresh cilantro if using.

## Pro Tips

- **For Extra-Crisp Skins:** After scooping, pat the inside of the shells completely dry with a paper towel before oiling and baking. This ensures maximum crispiness.
- **Chicken Swap:** Use leftover **grilled chicken thighs** or even shredded pork for a different flavor profile. This makes it a fantastic way to use up leftovers for an **easy dinner**.
- **Spice It Up:** Add a pinch of cayenne to the chicken mixture or top with pickled jalapeños before baking for a kick. This **cheesy chicken bake** can be as mild or bold as you like.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store any leftover **loaded potato skins** in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a 350°F oven for 10-12 minutes to restore crispiness. The chicken filling can also be stored separately and used in tacos or salads later in the week.
