Let’s be honest, sometimes you just crave something comforting and satisfying without spending hours in the kitchen. That’s exactly what *this Cheesy Potato Muffins: Crispy & Soft recipe* delivers! I stumbled upon the idea while trying to use up a mountain of leftover mashed potatoes – a common occurrence in my busy household.  I wanted something more exciting than just adding them to shepherd’s pie, and the thought of individual, golden-brown muffins filled with cheesy potato goodness just popped into my head. These aren’t your average potato dishes; they’re delightfully crispy on the outside, incredibly soft and fluffy on the inside, and bursting with cheesy flavor. They’re a fantastic way to elevate a simple weeknight dinner and are a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.  Seriously, these are the perfect quick and easy dinner recipes for busy families!  They’re also fantastic served alongside a simple salad or roasted vegetables – a complete and delicious meal.

I’ve tweaked this recipe over the years to get the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The secret is a little bit of cornstarch to help create that beautiful, crispy exterior, and plenty of sharp cheddar cheese for maximum cheesy goodness.  These Cheesy Potato Muffins are a fantastic alternative to traditional mashed potatoes and are a great way to sneak extra veggies into your kids’ (and your own!) diet.  They’re incredibly versatile too – you can add different herbs and spices to customize the flavor to your liking.  I often add a pinch of paprika and garlic powder for an extra layer of deliciousness.  They’re a true testament to how simple ingredients can create something truly special.  This recipe is a winner for anyone looking for easy dinner recipes.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin thoroughly.
2. In a large bowl, mash the potatoes until smooth.
3. Add the melted butter, flour, eggs, cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the mashed potatoes. Mix until well combined.
4. Stir in the cornstarch until the mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.
5. Spoon the potato mixture into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.
6. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until the muffins are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Let the muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Pro Tips

- For an extra crispy exterior, brush the tops of the muffins with a little extra melted butter before baking.
- If you don’t have sharp cheddar, you can use mild cheddar or a combination of cheeses.
- Feel free to add other seasonings like paprika, onion powder, or cayenne pepper for a little kick.
