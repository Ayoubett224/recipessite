## Ingredients

*   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1.5-inch pieces
*   1 cup all-purpose flour
*   1 tablespoon paprika
*   1 tablespoon garlic powder
*   1 tablespoon onion powder
*   1 teaspoon salt
*   1 teaspoon black pepper
*   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat)
*   2 large eggs
*   1/2 cup buttermilk
*   1/2 cup honey
*   1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
*   1 teaspoon garlic powder
*   1/2 teaspoon salt
*   1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
2.  **Prepare Dredging Station:** In a shallow dish, combine the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne (if using). In another shallow dish, beat the eggs lightly.
3.  **Dredge:** Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip off. First, dredge each piece thoroughly in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip into the beaten egg, letting excess drip off. Finally, dredge again in the seasoned flour, pressing gently to adhere a thick, even coating.
4.  **Fry:** Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350°F (175°C). Carefully add 3-4 chicken pieces at a time, avoiding overcrowding. Fry for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature reaches 165°F / 74°C). Adjust heat to maintain oil temperature. Transfer cooked chicken to a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
5.  **Make Honey Butter Glaze:** While chicken fries, whisk together the honey, melted butter, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a small saucepan. Warm gently over low heat until smooth and combined.
6.  **Glaze:** Once all chicken is fried and drained, place it back in the empty skillet (or use a clean one). Pour the warm honey butter glaze over the chicken pieces, tossing gently to coat evenly. Cook over low heat for 2-3 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the glaze is sticky and glossy.
7.  **Rest & Serve:** Transfer the glazed chicken to a serving platter. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. Serve hot and enjoy the crispy, honeyed perfection!

## Pro Tips

*   **Oil Temperature is Key:** Use a candy thermometer to maintain the oil at 350°F (175°C) for even cooking and perfect crispiness.
*   **Double Dredge:** This step is crucial for building that thick, protective, and incredibly crispy coating.
*   **Don't Crowd the Pan:** Frying in batches prevents the oil temperature from dropping too much, ensuring even cooking.
*   **Rest the Chicken:** Letting the fried chicken rest on a wire rack after frying helps excess oil drip off, keeping it crispier for longer.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store leftover Crispy Honey Butter Fried Chicken in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes to restore crispiness, or enjoy cold.
