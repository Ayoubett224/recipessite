## Why You'll Love This Recipe

*   **Quick & Easy:** Ready in just 20 minutes, making it perfect for busy weeknights or when you need a sweet treat fast.
*   **Healthy Indulgence:** Packed with protein and antioxidants from the Greek yogurt and berries, it’s a guilt-free dessert.
*   **Versatile:** Easily customizable with different berries, granola, or a touch of honey.
*   **Creamy Texture:** The Greek yogurt creates a wonderfully smooth and decadent texture that’s surprisingly light.

## Ingredients

*   24 ounces (680g) Plain Greek Yogurt (full-fat or 2% is recommended)
*   1 cup (150g) Fresh Mixed Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries)
*   1/4 cup (60ml) Honey (or maple syrup, to taste)
*   1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
*   1/2 cup (50g) Granola (optional, for topping)
*   Fresh Mint Leaves (for garnish, optional)

## Instructions

1.  In a large bowl, gently combine the Greek yogurt, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined and the honey is fully dissolved.
2.  Add the fresh mixed berries to the yogurt mixture. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to keep the berries intact.
3.  Divide the yogurt and berry mixture evenly among four serving bowls or glasses.
4.  If using, sprinkle each serving with granola.
5.  Garnish with fresh mint leaves, if desired.
6.  Serve immediately or chill for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. This Greek Yogurt Berry Dessert: Healthy & Creamy is best enjoyed cold!

## Pro Tips

*   For a tangier flavor, use full-fat Greek yogurt.
*   If you don’t have fresh berries, frozen berries work perfectly fine – just thaw them slightly before adding them to the yogurt.
*   Add a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg for a warmer flavor profile.
*   To make it even more decadent, swirl in a tablespoon of melted dark chocolate.

## Storage & Leftovers

Store leftover Greek Yogurt Berry Dessert: Healthy & Creamy in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The granola may soften over time.
