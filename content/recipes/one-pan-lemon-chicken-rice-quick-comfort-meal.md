## Why You'll Love This Recipe
- One‑pan cooking saves time and dishes  
- Bright lemon garlic chicken adds fresh flavor  
- Fluffy rice absorbs all the delicious juices  
- Ready in under 40 minutes for hectic evenings  

## Ingredients
- 4 bone‑in, skin‑on chicken thighs (about 1.5 lb)  
- 1 cup long‑grain white rice, rinsed  
- 2 cups low‑sodium chicken broth  
- 1 large lemon (zest and juice)  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tablespoon olive oil  
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano  
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme  
- ½ teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)  
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper  
- ½ cup frozen peas (optional)  
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions
1. Pat the chicken thighs dry, season both sides with salt and pepper, then heat olive oil in a large oven‑safe skillet over medium‑high heat. Brown the chicken, skin side down, for 4‑5 minutes until golden; flip and brown the other side 3 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.  
2. Reduce heat to medium, add minced garlic to the pan and sauté 30 seconds until fragrant.  
3. Stir in the rinsed rice, coating it with the pan juices, and toast for 1‑2 minutes.  
4. Sprinkle oregano and thyme over the rice, then pour in the chicken broth, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Stir to combine.  
5. Return the browned chicken thighs to the skillet, nestling them into the rice mixture. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20‑25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 °F.  
6. If using peas, scatter them over the top during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Remove the lid and let the dish rest for 5 minutes.  
7. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.

## Pro Tips
- Use bone‑in chicken thighs for juicier meat and richer flavor.  
- Toast the rice before adding broth to enhance nutty notes.  
- Add a splash of dry white wine after the garlic for extra depth.

## Storage & Leftovers
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days; reheat gently in the microwave or skillet with a splash of broth to restore moisture.
