## Ingredients

*   1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved if thick
*   1/2 cup BBQ sauce (your favorite, divided)
*   8 slices thick-cut bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled
*   1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
*   1/4 cup ranch dressing
*   1/4 cup mayonnaise
*   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
*   1 teaspoon garlic powder
*   1/2 teaspoon onion powder
*   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
*   1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
*   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
*   1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
*   1/4 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
*   1/4 cup finely chopped celery
*   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus extra for garnish

## Instructions

1.  Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2.  Place the chicken breasts in the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/4 cup of the BBQ sauce evenly over the top of each chicken breast.
3.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the ranch dressing, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using) until smooth.
4.  In a separate small bowl, combine the crumbled bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, red onion, green bell pepper, celery, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Mix well.
5.  Spread the ranch dressing mixture evenly over the BBQ sauce-covered chicken breasts.
6.  Generously sprinkle the bacon-cheese-vegetable mixture over the top of the ranch dressing.
7.  Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches 165°F/74°C) and the cheese is melted and bubbly, with the top slightly golden.
8.  Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with extra chopped parsley.

## Pro Tips

*   **Thick-Cut Bacon Wins:** Using thick-cut bacon ensures the best texture – it doesn't get soggy and provides satisfying crunch.
*   **Pre-Cooked Bacon Hack:** For even quicker prep, use pre-cooked bacon slices that you simply chop and crumble.
*   **Customize the Heat:** Adjust the cayenne pepper or add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the ranch mixture for extra kick.
*   **Fresh Parsley Power:** Don't skip the fresh parsley garnish – it adds a vital burst of freshness that balances the rich flavors.
