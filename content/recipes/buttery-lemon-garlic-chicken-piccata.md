## Why You'll Love This Recipe
- **Ready in Under 40 Minutes**: From pantry to plate in just two quick steps – perfect for busy schedules!
- **Restaurant-Quality Flavor**: Achieves that signature piccata tang with pantry staples like lemons, garlic, and white wine.
- **Naturally Gluten-Free**: Uses almond flour instead of traditional dredging for a lighter, healthier twist.
- **Versatile & Customizable**: Swap lemon for capers or add fresh herbs to match your mood!

## Ingredients
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 oz each), pounded to ¼-inch thickness
- ½ cup almond flour
- ¼ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc)
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 2 lemons (juiced + 1 sliced for garnish)
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tsp cornstarch (optional for thicker sauce)

## Instructions
1. **Prepare Chicken**: Place chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound to ¼-inch thickness using a meat mallet. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. **Dredge Chicken**: Spread almond flour on a plate. Dredge each chicken breast in almond flour, shaking off excess.
3. **Sauté Chicken**: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with foil.
4. **Make Sauce**: Reduce heat to medium. Add 2 tbsp butter to the skillet and melt. Add minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
5. **Deglaze Pan**: Pour in white wine, scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Simmer for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
6. **Combine Liquids**: Add chicken broth and lemon juice. Bring to a gentle simmer.
7. **Thicken Sauce (Optional)**: If using cornstarch, whisk 1 tsp with 1 tbsp cold water until dissolved. Add to sauce and stir until thickened (about 1 minute).
8. **Finish & Serve**: Return chicken to the skillet. Add remaining 2 tbsp butter and parsley, swirling until butter melts and sauce coats chicken. Garnish with lemon slices and parsley. Serve immediately over rice or zucchini noodles.

## Pro Tips
- **Pound Evenly**: For uniform cooking, ensure chicken breasts are pounded to consistent thickness.
- **Don't Overcrowd**: Cook chicken in batches if needed to maintain crispy coating and golden sear.
- **Adjust Tang**: Taste sauce before serving and add more lemon juice or a pinch of sugar if needed for balance.

## Storage & Leftovers
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Re gently in a skillet with a splash of broth to prevent the sauce from separating.
